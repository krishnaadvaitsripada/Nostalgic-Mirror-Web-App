What I'm trying to achieve here:
- using a database of images of people's faces 
  with the file name being their full name,
  I want to recognize faces over a video stream.
- then, i want to figure out how can i use a pygame
  display to draw graphics on top of the video 
  stream from DeepFace

Ideas:
 - in the future, i want to use the age and emotion
   detection feature

How do we make DeepFace understand that there are different faces
in the given photo album, then categorize each person, then ask
the user on the frontend to give the faces names
